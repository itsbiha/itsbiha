I am a undergraduate student of Economics and Business at Universitas 17 Agustus 1945, Samarinda. I am equipped with strong analytical skills and organizational experiences in various projects and positions. Currently enrolled in Bangkit Academy 2022 program, I have a big interest in data science, particularly Cloud Computing. I am looking forward to any opportunities in Cloud Computing or Web Development internships and jobs to apply all my experiences and skills and potentially grow my skill sets.
